                <h2>Factors to Consider Before Installation</h2>
                <p>Before installing an AC system, several factors need to be considered to ensure you choose the right unit for your home:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Size of the Unit</b>: An undersized AC will struggle to cool your space, while an oversized unit will cool too quickly without adequately dehumidifying the air. To find the right size, calculate the cooling capacity needed in British Thermal Units (BTUs). A general guideline is to use 20 BTUs per square foot of living space. For more precise calculations, consider factors like ceiling height, insulation quality, and sunlight exposure.</li>
                    <li><b>Energy Efficiency</b>: Look for units with a high Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER) rating. Higher SEER ratings indicate more efficient units, leading to lower energy bills. The U.S. Department of Energy recommends a SEER rating of at least 14 for optimal efficiency.</li>
                    <li><b>Ductwork Condition</b>: If you’re opting for a central AC system, inspect your ductwork for leaks, insulation quality, and overall condition. Poorly maintained ducts can lead to significant energy loss and reduced cooling efficiency.</li>
                    <li><b>Installation Location</b>: Consider where to place the outdoor and indoor units. The outdoor unit should be located in a shaded area with good airflow, while the indoor unit should be centrally located for optimal air distribution.</li>
                    <li><b>Budget</b>: Determine your budget for both the unit and installation costs. While cheaper units may save you money upfront, investing in a high-quality system may save you more in energy bills and maintenance costs over time.</li>
                </ol>
